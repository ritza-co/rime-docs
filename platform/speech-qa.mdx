Think of this as your **spell-check for speech**.
Rime’s models power the voice of your product, and the [**Speech QA Dashboard**](https://app.rime.ai/oov/) makes sure everything sounds right before it reaches your users.

## Why this matters

- Audit and correct those tricky **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words** (brand names, technical jargon, product terms).
- Catch **mismatches between your LLM and our speech engine** so you don’t ship weird pronunciations.
- Approve the good ones, fix the bad ones, and keep your audio experience seamless.

<Note>
  This feature is available for Mist Cloud users. We're starting out with
  English, but will expand to Arcana, On-Prem, and full language coverage soon!
</Note>

## Getting started

Turn it on with a single parameter:

```json
{
  "saveOov": true
}
```
For example, sending the request
```bash
curl -X POST "http://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $RIME_API_KEY" \
   -H "Accept: audio/mp3" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"modelId": "mistv2", "text": "we found something in the interphalangeal joint.", "speaker": "cove", "saveOovs": true}' \
  -o speech_with_oov.mp3
```
will save any out-of-vocabulary words found in `text` to your QA dashboard.

Once there:

1. Any words we can’t confidently pronounce get surfaced in your Speech QA dashboard.
2. You can listen to how they sound right now.
3. Approve if it’s fine, or Submit if it needs fixing.
4. Our linguists update the dictionary, and once it’s live, you’ll see it under Added to Dictionary.

## What you can do
