Rime provides text-to-speech AI models built specifically for real-time conversation. These models boast a sub-200ms latency that maintains conversational flow with no awkward silences. The models are trained on natural speech patterns to give your AI agents a voice that your customers actually want to talk to.

Rime offers two flagship models. **Arcana** produces ultra-realistic voices that capture the warmth and rhythm of human speech, including natural elements like laughter and breathing. **Mistv2** prioritizes speed and control, delivering accurate pronunciation with fine-grained customization options for high-volume applications.

The API supports **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, **German**, and **Hindi**, with voices across different demographics and accents. With the phonetic markup to handle tricky brand names, currencies, and personal details such as IDs and phone numbers, the Rime models can be customized to create the perfect voice to represent your company and brand.

Rime supports flexible deployment options from cloud API to virtual private cloud, to on-premises, with no concurrency limits.
