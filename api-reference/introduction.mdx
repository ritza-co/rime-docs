Rime provides text-to-speech AI models built specifically for real-time conversation. These models boast a sub-200ms latency that maintains conversational flow with no awkward silences. The models are trained on natural speech patterns to give your AI agents a voice that customers actually want to talk to.

Rime offers two flagship models:

- **Arcana** produces ultra-realistic voices that capture the warmth and rhythm of human speech, including natural elements like laughter and breathing. 
- **Mistv2** prioritizes speed and control, delivering accurate pronunciation with fine-grained customization options for high-volume applications.

The Rime API supports **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, **German**, and **Hindi**, with voices across different demographics and accents. Rime uses phonetic markup to handle tricky brand names, currencies, and personal details (such as IDs and phone numbers), so you can customize models to create the perfect voice that represents your company and brand.

Rime supports flexible deployment options, from cloud API and virtual private cloud, to on-premises, with no concurrency limits.
