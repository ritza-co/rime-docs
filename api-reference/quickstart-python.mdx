This guide will show you how to generate your first audio clip with Rime's TTS API and experiment with different voices and speech customizations.

## Prerequisites

For this guide you will need a Rime API token. To get a token, create a free [Rime account](https://app.rime.ai/signup/). Then, from the Rime dashboard, navigate to the [API Tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/) page and copy the API key for later use.

We will be using **Python** to send requests to the Rime API so install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) or later.

## Set Up Your Environment

Create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the requests library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Create Your Python Script

Create a file called `rime_hello_world.py` and import the requests library.

```python
import requests
```
Next, create the request to the Rime API. Set the request headers specifying the Rime API key that you copied.

```python
RIME_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

headers = {
    "Accept": "audio/mp3",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {RIME_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```
Now, create a payload where we will specify the details of the request to the API.

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "celeste",
    "modelId": "arcana"
}
```

There are many optional parameters that we could send to the API but the following are required:
- `text` - The text to convert to speech
- `speaker` - The voice to use (see [voices](/api-reference/voices))
- `modelId` - Use `arcana` for the most realistic voices, or `mistv2` for faster synthesis

See the [api-reference](/api-reference/arcana/streaming-mp3) for more optional parameters.

Now that our headers and payload are created, make a POST request to the Rime API and write the streamed audio response to a file.

```python
with requests.post(
    "https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts",
    headers=headers,
    json=payload,
    stream=True
) as response:
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=4096):
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)

print("Audio saved to output.mp3")
```

Streaming writes audio chunks as they arrive, reducing memory usage for longer text.

Test the script by simply running it from the terminal.

```bash
python rime_hello_world.py
```

On a successful run, we should see confirmation that our audio file is saved.

```bash
'Audio saved to output.mp3'
```

## Choose a Voice

Rime offers a range of voices with different personalities. To change the voice, update the `speaker` parameter in your request.

```python
json={
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "orion",  # Try different voices here
    "modelId": "arcana",
    "samplingRate": 24000
}
```

Browse all available voices on the [voices page](/api-reference/voices).

## Custom Pronunciation

The `mistv2` model offers a way to specify pronunciation of brand names or uncommon words using Rime's [phonetic alphabet](/api-reference/custom-pronunciation). Add the custom pronunciation in curly brackets and set `phonemizeBetweenBrackets` to `true`:

```python
json={
    "text": "Welcome to {r1Ym} labs.",
    "speaker": "peak",
    "modelId": "mistv2",
    "samplingRate": 24000,
    "phonemizeBetweenBrackets": True
}
```

Use the [Pronunciation tool](https://rime.ai/dashboard/pronunciation) in the dashboard to generate phonetic strings for any word.

## Next Steps

Now that you can generate TTS audio, the [next guide](/api-reference/quickstart-livekit) will explore how to enable a real-time conversation between you and an agent.
