This guide will show you how to generate your first audio clip with Rime's text-to-speech (TTS) API and experiment with different voices and speech customizations.

## Prerequisites

- A Rime API token. Create a free [Rime account](https://app.rime.ai/signup/). Then, from the Rime dashboard, navigate to the [API Tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/) page and copy the API key for later use.

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) to send requests to the Rime API.

## Create your python script

Create a file called `rime_hello_world.py` and import the required library modules.

```python
import json
import urllib.request
```
Next, create a request to the Rime API. Set the request headers specifying the Rime API key that you copied.

```python
RIME_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

headers = {
    "Accept": "audio/mp3",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {RIME_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```
Now, create a payload specifying the details of the request to the API.

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "celeste",
    "modelId": "arcana"
}
```

Set the following required parameters:
- `text` adds the text to convert to speech
- `speaker`: The voice to use (see [voices](/api-reference/voices))
- `modelId`: Use `arcana` for the most realistic voices, or `mistv2` for faster synthesis

See the [Arcana API reference](/api-reference/arcana/streaming-mp3) for more optional parameters.

Now that you've created the headers and payload, make a `POST` request to the Rime API and write the streamed audio response to a file.

```python
data = json.dumps(payload).encode("utf-8")

request = urllib.request.Request(
    "https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts",
    data=data,
    headers=headers,
    method="POST"
)

with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
        while chunk := response.read(4096):
            f.write(chunk)

print("Audio saved to output.mp3")
```

Streaming allows audio playback to begin before generation completes. This enables conversational flow as the user can begin to hear the responses before the entire audio clip is generated. As you are writing to a file in this example, this is less important. But it will become crucial when using these models in real-time conversations.

Test the script by running it from the terminal:

```bash
python rime_hello_world.py
```

On a successful run, the terminal displays the following confirmation that our audio file is saved:

```bash
'Audio saved to output.mp3'
```

<audio controls src="/sounds/example-output.mp3"></audio>

## Choose a voice

Rime offers a range of voices with different personalities. To change the voice, update the `speaker` parameter in your request:

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "orion",  # Try different voices here
    "modelId": "arcana"
}
```

Browse all available voices on the [Voices](/api-reference/voices) page.

## Custom pronunciation

The `mistv2` model lets you specify pronunciation of brand names or uncommon words using Rime's [phonetic alphabet](/api-reference/custom-pronunciation). Add the custom pronunciation in curly brackets and set `phonemizeBetweenBrackets` to `true`:

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Welcome to {r1Ym} labs.",
    "speaker": "peak",
    "modelId": "mistv2",
    "phonemizeBetweenBrackets": True
}
```

Use the [Pronunciation tool](https://rime.ai/dashboard/pronunciation) in the dashboard to generate phonetic strings for any word.

## Next steps

Now that you can generate TTS audio, the [LiveKit quickstart guide](/api-reference/quickstart-livekit) will explore how to enable a real-time conversation between you and an agent.
