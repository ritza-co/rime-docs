title: 'Punctuation'
---

Punctuation serves many purposes in normal writing, it indicates sentence structural things like sentence breaks and questions, but it also serves to indicate pronunciation cues, such as commas for pauses and exclamation points for excitement. 

For Rime text-to-speech, these various uses are even more flexible. Not only can users employ punctuation for traditional structural purposes, users can modulate the prosody by using differing punctuation. Below we show some basic ways our powerful engine can alter the prosody using punctuation. These are just a few examples, feel free to play around and see what you can create!

## Questions

|-----------------|--------------------------|---|
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/whatdoyoumeanperiod.wav"></audio>     |    what do you mean.      |  a simple period at the end of the sentence renders it a non-question  |
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/whatdoyoumeanquestion.wav"></audio>    |      what do you mean?        |  a simple question mark indicates an unmarked question |
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/whatdoyoumeaninterrobang.wav"></audio>    |       what do you mean?!       |  adding an exclamation point makes the question more excited |
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/whatdoyoumeanexclamq.wav"></audio>    |          what do you mean!?      |  changing the order of the exclamation point and question mark makes a different sort of question |
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/whatdoyoumeanqq.wav"></audio>     |     what do you mean??         |  multiple question marks can also change the type of question prosody |
