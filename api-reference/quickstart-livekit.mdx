In this guide, we'll build an interactive voice agent using LiveKit and Rime. The agent listens to speech, processes it through an LLM, and responds with Rime's realistic TTS voices. By the end, you'll have a working voice agent you can talk to in your browser or terminal.

## Prerequisites

## Project Setup

## Configure Rime as Your TTS Provider

## Create a Basic Voice Agent

## Run and Test Your Agent

## Customize Your Agent's Voice
