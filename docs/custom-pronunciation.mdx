title: 'Custom pronunciation'
---

For uncommon words, such as unique brand names or product names, Rime's speech synthesis model may not always pronounce them correctly out of the box. 

While the Rime team can add new words to the dictionary within around 24 hours, if you want to specify the pronunciation yourself, you can input a custom pronunciation string within curly brackets.

Tools exist both to [check the dictionary coverage](#check-coverage) and to [generate a custom pronunciation string](#get-pronunciation).

Custom pronunciations use Rime's phonetic alphabet (detailed [below](#rimes-phonetic-alphabet)), which is inspired by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For example, the word `custom` would be represented as `{k1Ast0xm}`. This even works for made-up words, like `gorbulets`, which would be `{g1orby0ul2Ets}`.

|    Audio clip     |      Sentence             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/gorbulets.wav"></audio>     |    actually, `{g1orby0ul2Ets}` is a word i just made up.      |

> **Note:** When making an API request, you must set `phonemizeBetweenBrackets` to `true`. The request would look like this:

```python Custom pronunciation example
{
	"text": "actually, {g1orby0ul2Ets} is a word i just made up.",
    "speaker": "peak",
    "modelId": "mistv2",
    "phonemizeBetweenBrackets": true
}
```

## Check coverage

The **Check Coverage** tool is available on the Rime dashboard: [rime.ai/dashboard/coverage](https://rime.ai/dashboard/coverage). You can also check coverage [via the API](/api-reference/endpoint/oov).

You can check to see if any word or list of words is included in the Rime dictionary before generating a custom pronunciation.

## Get pronunciation

The **Pronunciation** tool is available on the Rime dashboard: [rime.ai/dashboard/pronunciation](https://rime.ai/dashboard/pronunciation).

To generate a custom pronunciation, all you have to do is spell and record yourself speaking the word, then click **GENERATE**.

When you click **GENERATE**, you'll send your recording to Rime's proprietary pronunciation model, which will return a pronunciation string using Rime's phonetic alphabet. You can then listen to the word spoken by any of Rime's voices and make any edits to the generated pronunciation.

### Stress

For primary stress, put `1` before the relevant vowel. For example, `comma` would be `{k1am0x}`.

For secondary stress, put `2` in front of the relevant vowel. For example, `auctioneer` would be `{2akS0In1ir}`.

All other vowels should have a `0` in front of them.
