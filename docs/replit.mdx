[Replit](https://replit.com/) is an AI-powered platform that lets you create and publish apps from a single browser tab. No local setup, no environment headaches. Just describe what you want to build, and Replit's AI agent handles the heavy lifting.

With Rime's text-to-speech integration, you can add natural, lifelike voices to your Replit apps in minutes. Whether you're building a voiceover tool, an accessibility feature, or an AI assistant, Rime + Replit makes it surprisingly simple.

## What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A [Replit account](https://replit.com/signup)
- A Rime API key from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/)

## Quick Start

Replit's Agent understands external integrations. When you mention Rime TTS and provide the API details, it automatically sets up the code, prompts you for your API key, and stores it securely in [Replit Secrets](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets). Your credentials never touch your frontend code.

**Step 1:** In your Replit prompt, tell it to use Rime as the TTS provider. Include the API details so the Agent knows exactly how to integrate:

```
Use Rime TTS
API: POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
Header: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
```

**Step 2:** When Replit asks for the API key, paste in the key you grabbed from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/). Replit stores it as an encrypted secret and handles the rest.

That's it. Two steps and you've got voice synthesis in your app.

## Example: Voiceover Studio

Want to see what's possible? Here's a complete prompt that builds a professional voiceover studio with Rime TTS. Use it as inspiration or paste it directly into Replit:

```
Build an Instant Voiceover Studio, a single-page app where users paste text, 
pick a voice, and generate professional audio using Rime TTS.

For: Content creators who need quick voiceovers for YouTube, podcasts, and apps.

Design: Rime design language with near-black background (#0D0D0D, #161616), 
orange-to-red gradient accents (#FF9300 to #B10000), grey surfaces (#333, #1A1A1A), 
Inter font. Clean and premium.

Layout (two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile):

Left Panel:
1. Text input area with character count (5000 max)
2. Voice picker with a grid of 16 Arcana voice cards (luna, astra, sirius, estelle, lyra, vespera, walnut, eliphas, arcade, atrium, eucalyptus, fern, stucco, transom, oculus, moss) with gradient avatars

3. "Generate Voiceover" button following Rime design language
4. Audio controls with play/pause, progress bar, download wav

Right Panel:
5. Three.js particle sphere with a small orb of 500+ particles, centered in the 
   right panel. Slowly rotates when idle with dim orange tint. When audio plays: 
   particles expand outward and glow bright orange (#FF9300) to red (#B10000), 
   pulsing with the voice.

Use Rime TTS
API: POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
