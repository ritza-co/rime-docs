title: 'Speed control'
---

Rime allows you to customize the speaking speed of your voice agents, enabling you to:
- Enhance accessibility for diverse audiences.
- Tailor speech to specific applications (for example, slower pace for explanatory materials).
- Optimize the conversation to suit various contexts.

Learn how to adjust the speaking speed using Rime's APIs.

## Adjusting the overall speed

Overall speaking speed in Rime is controlled using the `speedAlpha` parameter. 

Lower than 1.0 is faster than the default. Higher than 1.0 is slower than the default.

```js
{
    ...otherParams,
    "text": "Hello, world!",
    "speedAlpha": 1.2
}
```

## Adjusting the speed of individual words

To adjust the speed of individual words or phrases, use the `inlineSpeedAlpha` parameter.

`inlineSpeedAlpha` takes a comma-separated list of speed values applied to words in square brackets. Values < 1.0 speed up speech, > 1.0 slow it down. 

For example: “This sentence is [really] [fast]” with inlineSpeedAlpha “0.5, 3” will make “really” slow and “fast” fast.

```js
{
    ...otherParams,
    "text": "This sentence is [really] [fast]",
    "inlineSpeedAlpha": "0.5, 3"
}
```

## Recommendations

By effectively utilizing Rime's speed control features, you can create more varied conversational AI experiences.

- Use `speedAlpha` to adjust the overall speed of the speech.
- Use `inlineSpeedAlpha` to adjust the speed of individual words or phrases.
- Experiment with different values to find the best fit for your use case.
- Be mindful that large speed adjustments may impact the naturalness and clarity of the synthesized speech.
