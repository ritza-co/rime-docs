## Acronyms and initialisms

Acronyms are pronounced as a single word. For example, NASA is pronounced as "Nasa". Initialisms are pronounced as a series of letters. For example, DNA is pronounced as "D N A".

By default, Rime will pronounce a series of capital letters as an acronym, that is, as a single word. However, for many common initialisms, such as DNA, ID, USA, FBI, and CIA, Rime will automatically pronounce them correctly as a series of letters.

That being said, to ensure that initialisms are pronounced correctly as a series of letters, the best practice is **to use lower case** and to put a period and space after each letter.

| Desired output | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Nasa | NASA |
| D N A | DNA |
| D N A | d. n. a. |
| UPS | u. p. s. |
| GPA | g. p. a. |

> **Note:** You can also specify a custom pronunciation for any acronym or initialism, using Rime's [custom pronunciations](/docs/custom-pronunciations) feature.
