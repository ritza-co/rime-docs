[LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) is a realtime platform that enables developers to build video, voice, and data capabilities into their applications. Building on WebRTC, it supports a broad range of frontend and backend platforms.

Rime's text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model is available via the LiveKit API. With LiveKit's Rime integration and the Agents framework, you can build AI voice applications that are responsive and sound realistic.

More information is available in [LiveKit's documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/rime/).
