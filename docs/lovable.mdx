[Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) is an AI-powered platform that lets anyone, regardless of technical skill, build full-stack web applications using natural language. Just describe what you want, and Lovable builds it for you.

With Rime's text-to-speech integration, you can now add natural, lifelike voice capabilities to your Lovable apps with just a few lines in your prompt. Whether you're building a voiceover tool, an accessibility feature, or an AI assistant, getting Rime TTS into your Lovable project is surprisingly simple.

## How It Works

Since Rime's API requires authentication, Lovable handles this securely through [Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/cloud). Your API key gets stored as a secret and accessed through Edge Functions, so it's never exposed in your frontend code.

Here's how to get started:

**Step 1:** Grab your Rime API key from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/)

**Step 2:** In your Lovable prompt, explicitly tell it to use Rime as the TTS provider. Include the API details so Lovable knows exactly how to wire things up:

```
Use Rime TTS
**API:** POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
- Header: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
- Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
Store the API key in Lovable Cloud.
```

**Step 3:** When Lovable prompts you to enable Cloud and add a secret, paste in your Rime API key. That's it, Lovable handles the rest.

For a deeper understanding of how Lovable manages authenticated APIs, check out their [integration docs](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/introduction#authenticated-apis-requires-secrets).

## Try It Yourself

Here's a real prompt you can paste into Lovable to build a voiceover studio app:

```
Build an Instant Voiceover Studio, a single-page app where users paste text, 
pick a voice, and generate professional audio using Rime TTS.

**For:** Content creators who need quick voiceovers for YouTube, podcasts, and apps.

**Design:** Rime design language with near-black background (#0D0D0D, #161616), 
orange-to-red gradient accents (#FF9300 to #B10000), grey surfaces (#333, #1A1A1A), 
Inter font. Clean and premium.

**Layout (two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile):**

**Left Panel:**
1. Text input area with character count (5000 max)
2. Voice picker with a grid of 16 Arcana voice cards (luna, astra, sirius, estelle, lyra, vespera, walnut, eliphas, arcade, atrium, eucalyptus, fern, stucco, transom, oculus, moss) with gradient avatars
3. "Generate Voiceover" button
4. Audio controls with play/pause, progress bar, download wav

**Right Panel:**
5. Three.js particle sphere with a small orb of 500+ particles, centered in the 
   right panel. Slowly rotates when idle with dim orange tint. When audio plays: 
   particles expand outward and glow bright orange (#FF9300) to red (#B10000), 
   pulsing with the voice.

Use Rime TTS
**API:** POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
- Header: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
- Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
Store the API key in Lovable Cloud.
```

Feel free to tweak the design, swap out voices, or completely reimagine the app. The key is including those Rime TTS instructions so Lovable knows how to connect everything.

## Tips for Better Results

- Be specific about what you want. Lovable works best with clear, detailed prompts
- Always include the full API details (endpoint, headers, docs link) so Lovable can implement the integration correctly
- Explicitly mention storing the API key in Lovable Cloud for security
- Check out Lovable's [prompt engineering guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/prompting/prompting-one) for more tips on crafting effective prompts
